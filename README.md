#  Amuseum

### Your museum to all your Amusements!

Amuseum is a project I started for fun, but also a project where I wanted to have a reference to all the best practices that I had been researching and learning  for several months. 
Now Amuseum is far than complete it is just the start; however, I thought of putting it on Github early on before completion, so that if anyone is interested in the practices used in the project,
and would like to, add their own input and start a discussion, it would be more than welcome.


## What can you find in this project?

1. MVVM
2. Not Rx, binding with just being swifty!
3. Protocol oriented programming
4. Generic Programming
5. Codable with inheritance
6. Codable with protocol inheritance (composition over classical inheritance)  with a way to assign default values (Coming soon)
7. Firebase
8. Beautiful UI (Coming soon)
9. Animations and interactive animations (Coming soon)
10. Coordinator pattern (Coming soon)
11. Localization
12. Whatever you suggest !!!


## Future Plans

For the future, I am looking forward to replacing the Firebase backend stack, and implement the backend in Vapor! And yes that project will be posted on github as well!

## Contributing

As I mentioned before this project is a cultivation of all the best practices over the months that I have learned, so mainly this project is an educational resource than anything else.
Thus, I am very open to any feedback and contribution. Lets help each other learn by open sourcing!
